## Introduction
With a never-ending stream of deadlines and tasks, it's easy to be overwhelmed without an effective task management system. Traditional task managers require you to interact with them through a graphical user interface, which is too slow for users like you! <i>Tusk</i> implements a new paradigm of task management.

While traditional task managers require you to interact with them through a graphical user interface, <i> Tusk </i> allows you to manage your tasks quickly through keyboard commands.

With <i>Tusk</i>, you can add, delete and edit tasks without a fuss. Through shortcuts that you define, you can create custom commands that make <i> Tusk </i> entirely yours over time. Managing tasks has never been such a breeze.

Get started with <i>Tusk</i> now!

<br>
## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

1. Download the latest `taskmanager.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

4. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.
5. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`help`** : lists all commands
   * **`add`**` Meeting, July 10, 5pm-6pm` :
     adds a `Meeting` task on `July 10, 5pm-6pm` to the Task Manager
   * **`alias`**` am add Meeting` : `am` is now a shortcut for `add Meeting`
   * **`exit`** : exits the app
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>

<br>

> * 1) `DAY MONTH` or `MONTH DAY`
> * 2) `DAY MONTH YEAR` or `MONTH DAY YEAR`
> * `MONTH` should be in alphabets instead of numbers.
> * `MONTH` can either be in the long-form ('October') or the short-form ('Oct'), and it is case-insensitive.
> * Any deviations from the above format may not be interpreted correctly.
