### Integrated Behavior

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 3`.

<img src="images/SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskManagerChangedEvent` when any Task related data is changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk. <br>
<img src="images/SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/w15c2/tusk/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`HelpPanel`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/w15c2/tusk/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `TaskManager` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

#### Use case: Adding a task

**MSS**

1. User adds a task
2. TaskManager adds the task<br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. The format of the input is wrong

> 1a1. TaskManager shows an error and prompts the user again reiterating the correct command format <br>
> Use Case resumes at step 1.

1b. The task limit has been reached

> 1b1. TaskManager displays an error and prompts the user to delete a task <br>
> Use Case ends.

<br>
#### Use case: Deleting a task

**MSS**

1. User requests to list tasks
2. TaskManager shows a list of tasks
3. User requests to delete a specific task in the list
4. TaskManager deletes the task <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. The list of tasks is empty

#### Use case: Undoing a command

**MSS**

1. User undos a command.
2. TaskManager returns to state before command is executed.
3. TaskManager displays that command that has been undone.<br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

#### Use case: Adding an Alias

**MSS**

1. User adds an Alias
2. TaskManager adds Alias<br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. The format of the input is wrong

> Use Case resumes at step 1.

1b. The user attempts to create an alias of a pre-existing alias

> 1b1. TaskManager displays an error <br>
> Use Case continues at step 1.

<br>

> Use Case resumes at step 1.

1a. The list of tasks is empty

> Use Case ends.

3a. The given index is invalid

> 3a1. TaskManager displays an error <br>
> Use Case resumes at step 3.

<br>
#### Use case: Marking a task as pinned

**MSS**
