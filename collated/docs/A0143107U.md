### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/w15c2/tusk/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task data in xml format and read it back.

<br>
### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `w15c2.tusk.commons` package.

<br>
## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations. Take note that:

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Warnings that indicate events that are somewhat serious but do not represent critical errors
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(default: `taskconfig.json`):

### Autocomplete

* `AutocompleteEngine` pulls data from `AutocompleteSource` to match the appropriate command words.
* `AutocompleteResult` creates the iterator to allow for <kbd>TAB</kbd> to cycle through the matched commands.

### Alias

* Aliases are checked when a command is entered against a list of aliases in `Model`
* If a match is found, the alias is replaced before the command is parsed as per normal.

### Command History

* Every command that is entered is added to a list in the `CommandHistory` class.
* When <kbd>UP</kbd> is pressed, index pointer is reduced by one and previous command replaces text in the command box.
* When <kbd>DOWN</kbd> is pressed, index pointer is increased by one and following command replaces text in the command box.

### Undo
* The `ModelHistory` class handles both the undo and redo commands
* When an undo-able command is executed, a `UniqueItemCollection` of the previous state is saved.
* An undo command will revert the state to before the command was executed by replacing the `UniqueItemCollection` in the `Model` class
* Before the execution of an undo command, the current `UniqueItemCollection` is saved to support redo.
